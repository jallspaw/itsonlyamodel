Korzybski, 1933</a>) A model is not the thing or things it is intended to represent. This means that every model will be an imperfect representation.

Box, 1976</a>) Models can be used for specific or general purposes and are inherently context-sensitive to those purposes. For example, reusing a model intended for teaching a concept may or may not be helpful as one intended to demonstrate an example of a concept.
